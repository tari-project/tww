Tari, a protocol for digital assets, has significantly upgraded its bug bounty
program, an initiative aimed at enhancing the security of its platform. In an
update posted on January 10, 2024, the Tari team announced an increase in the
rewards for identifying vulnerabilities, particularly in the form of Tari
tokens. This move coincides with the impending launch of the Minotari mainnet,
marking a crucial phase in Tari's development.

The updated bug bounty program, managed in partnership with HackerOne, offers
bounties up to $250,000 worth of XTR (Minotari tokens) for critical bugs such as
consensus-breaking vulnerabilities. The program also provides cash rewards for
various levels of security flaws, ranging from minor bugs to critical issues.
For example, critical vulnerabilities can fetch up to $5,000 in cash, while
high-severity issues offer up to $2,000. Medium and low-severity vulnerabilities
attract rewards of $750 and $100, respectively.

In addition to cash bounties, token-based rewards will be issued, with critical
issues potentially earning between $100,000 to $250,000 in Minotari tokens.
These token rewards are contingent on the post-launch price stabilization of
Minotari. The bounty program emphasizes that token rewards can only be claimed
post-launch, with a short delay to allow for price stabilization. All cash
rewards, however, will be disbursed through HackerOne, and participants are
required to register with the platform to claim them.

This enhanced bug bounty program reflects Tari's commitment to security and
community engagement, encouraging ethical hackers and security researchers to
contribute to the robustness of the Tari ecosystem.

In a startling revelation, security researchers have highlighted a significant
privacy breach in Apple's AirDrop feature, first reported to Apple in 2019, yet
apparently unaddressed. This flaw, according to a CNN report, has been recently
exploited by Chinese authorities to track down AirDrop users, raising serious
global privacy concerns. The feature, popular for sharing photos and documents
among nearby Apple users without needing an internet connection, was compromised
by a Beijing-based tech firm, enabling the identification of users allegedly
sharing "inappropriate information" on the Beijing subway.

The exploit of this vulnerability is particularly alarming given AirDrop's
widespread use, including by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. Researchers
from the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany had discovered these flaws
and even proposed a fix in 2021, but Apple seems not to have implemented these
changes. The vulnerability involves collecting basic identifying information
during AirDrop use, which, due to Apple's lack of additional security measures
like "salting," can be reverse-engineered from encrypted data. This oversight by
Apple has prompted urgent calls for transparency and action from internet
freedom advocates and top US lawmakers, concerned about the privacy and safety
of iPhone users worldwide.

The implications of this revelation are far-reaching. Not only does it spotlight
Apple's inaction in addressing known vulnerabilities, but it also raises
questions about the company's relationship with China, where Apple is
significantly invested. With the Chinese government's track record of leveraging
private sector technology for surveillance, this incident could have chilling
effects on the use of Apple's features like AirDrop for secure communication,
especially among dissenters. How Apple responds to this situation could redefine
its stance on user privacy and security in an increasingly digital and monitored
world.

The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new challenges
to maintaining children's privacy online, especially when it comes to posting
their pictures. This Deseret News article sheds light on the dangers of AI in
the context of sharing children’s images on social media and offers insights on
how to combat these privacy issues. With the proliferation of AI tools capable
of altering images, the seemingly harmless act of sharing kids' photos can have
unforeseen consequences.

The article cites instances, like a case reported by The Wall Street Journal,
where male students used AI to create fake nude photos of their female
classmates from pictures found on social media. This highlights the ease with
which AI can manipulate images, potentially leading to harmful outcomes. Experts
like Wael Abd-Almageed from the University of Southern California’s Information
Sciences Institute warn that once a child's photo is uploaded online, it's
nearly impossible to control its spread. These images can be reshared, archived,
and even find their way into encrypted chats or the dark web.

Addressing this issue, the article suggests caution and reflection before
posting a child’s image online. It urges parents to consider the permanence of
online data and offers practical advice on how to report and request the removal
of such content from platforms like Facebook and TikTok. The concept of
"sharenting," where parents extensively share their children’s lives on social
media, is also examined. The article encourages parents to ponder questions like
whether they would share certain information with a stranger or how it might
affect their child's trust and privacy. In an era where digital footprints are
indelible, this piece serves as a critical reminder for parents to be more
mindful of their children’s digital privacy.

A recent viral post on Facebook sparked widespread concern by claiming that the
popular video game platform Roblox uses 'biometric location tracking' to reveal
users' locations. However, this claim has been proven false, according to a USA
Today fact-check. Roblox, a widely used gaming platform, does not collect
precise location data from its users, contrary to the alarming assertions made
in the post. Any personal information, such as precise location or address,
shared in chat rooms or public forums on Roblox is actively filtered and removed
to protect users' privacy.

The article clarifies that biometric data, which refers to unique physical
characteristics used for automated recognition, is entirely separate from
physical location tracking. Roblox does collect some form of biometric data,
specifically face geometry, but this is solely for the purpose of identity and
age verification and has no connection to physical location tracking. Experts in
the field of information sciences and cybersecurity underscore the importance of
understanding the nature of data collected by platforms like Roblox and the
potential privacy risks associated with sharing personal information online.

Parents are advised to be vigilant about their children’s online activities and
privacy settings. While Roblox does not pose the specific threat claimed in the
viral post, experts emphasize the broader risks associated with sharing
information with strangers online, including the potential for radicalization in
some extreme cases. This fact-check serves as a reminder of the importance of
critical evaluation of online claims, especially those related to privacy and
security in digital platforms.

At CES 2024, Swiss company Punkt. introduced the MC02, the first smartphone to
feature Apostrophy OS, a new Android-based operating system designed to
prioritize user privacy. According to PCMag, Apostrophy OS offers a
"privacy-first" approach, giving users complete control over their personal
data, a feature increasingly sought after in today's digital age. The OS is
based on the open-source foundation of Android, and it uniquely allows users to
maintain their existing apps while ensuring privacy.

The MC02 aims to provide a full Android experience, including the option to use
Google services if desired. Apostrophy OS operates on a bespoke, OS-level
implementation of AOSP 13 and is divided into segments. One segment is dedicated
to protecting personal data and app integrity, while another, sandboxed area
permits access to Google's Play Store and the extensive range of mobile apps
available there. Interestingly, Apostrophy asserts that standard Android apps on
their platform only exchange data with app developers, not third parties like
Google, ensuring that one developer's app can't track usage of other apps.

Further emphasizing its commitment to privacy, the MC02 features built-in VPN
services and a Ledger tool for managing app permissions more intuitively. The
device itself, designed in Europe and manufactured in China, boasts a 6.7-inch
screen, a MediaTek Dimensity 900 processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a
5,500mAh battery. It also includes a 64MP main camera, an 8MP wide-angle camera,
a 2MP depth-sensing camera, and a 24MP selfie camera, along with 5G, Bluetooth
5.2, and Wi-Fi 6 support.

Priced at $749, the MC02 is now available for preorder and is expected to ship
by the end of January. This collaboration between Punkt. and Apostrophy reflects
a growing trend towards privacy-centric technology, catering to consumers
increasingly concerned about their digital privacy and data security.

When on a dream vacation, staying at a luxurious hotel can be a highlight worth
sharing. However, Trevor Cooke, an online privacy expert at EarthWeb, warns of a
common mistake many travelers make: posting pictures of their hotel room or
location in real-time on social media. This act of digital sharing, meant to
express joy and excitement, can inadvertently compromise your safety and
privacy.

Cooke advises against revealing your exact location or the duration of your stay
by posting hotel room pictures. Such posts can make you vulnerable to stalking,
targeted theft, or other security breaches. Another critical piece of advice is
to never disclose your room number online, as it could lead to unauthorized
charges to your account or other forms of criminal activity.

The risks extend beyond hotel stays. Posting airport check-in pictures or
boarding passes can signal to potential criminals that your home is unoccupied.
This, along with location-tagged photos, can expose your personal information,
putting your address, bank details, and overall safety at risk. To maintain
privacy and security, Cooke suggests waiting until you're safely back home to
share holiday memories.

This cautionary tale is not limited to social media behavior. A new scam
targeting hotel guests involves fraudsters calling your room, pretending to be
hotel staff, and asking for credit card details. Carolyn Pearson, CRO of travel
safety business Maiden Voyage, highlights this as an emerging threat for
travelers. The overarching message is clear: while sharing holiday experiences
is enjoyable, doing so responsibly is crucial for maintaining your privacy and
safety.

In her Wired article, Joy Buolamwini highlights the pressing challenges of
biometric privacy in 2024, driven by the rampant use of AI-powered facial
recognition and the rise of biometric identity theft. Individuals are
increasingly using generative AI tools and abundant online data for sinister
purposes, such as voice cloning scams. This trend is exemplified by an incident
in Arizona, where a mother received a distress call imitating her daughter's
voice, demanding money. Such scams are just the tip of the iceberg, with future
threats potentially involving more personalized and emotionally manipulative
tactics.

The misuse of biometric data extends beyond personal scams. It has profound
implications in law enforcement and governance. People of color and other
vulnerable groups face a higher risk of misidentification, leading to wrongful
arrests and detentions. The advent of generative AI allows for the creation of
false evidence, such as fabricated videos of alleged confessions. This
technology is not confined to state entities; its increasing accessibility means
that it could be used for creating deepfakes, intensifying threats like revenge
porn and child exploitation on the dark web.

As a response to these escalating privacy breaches, 2024 witnesses a rise in
anti-surveillance measures. Fashion statements double as privacy tools, with
face coverings emerging as both stylistic choices and necessary protections in
regions banning public biometrics. Parents advocate for their children to be
“biometric naive,” free from government or institutional data capture.
Innovations like eyewear to obscure ocular biometrics and 3D-printed face
prosthetics also gain traction, though their legality varies worldwide. In this
landscape, viewing an unaltered face becomes an unusual, intimate occurrence,
underscoring the deep impact of biometric surveillance on privacy and societal
norms.

In a Sky News article, Dr. Michael Zimmer, a university professor and privacy
expert, delves into the intricate world of Facebook and its founder, Mark
Zuckerberg. Dr. Zimmer, who has meticulously recorded "every single thing"
Zuckerberg has said in public since 2004 in an archive known as "The Zuckerberg
Files," sheds light on the evolving privacy concerns surrounding Facebook. The
archive, consisting of over 1,500 transcripts of Zuckerberg's public remarks,
offers a unique perspective on the social media giant's approach to user privacy
and data usage.

Dr. Zimmer acknowledges the real and significant privacy concerns surrounding
Facebook, particularly in how user data is collected and used. He stops short of
advising users to delete their accounts, recognizing the benefits of being on
the platform. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of users understanding and
managing their privacy settings. He notes that Facebook has improved its privacy
management tools, but suggests there's room for more enhancement.

Zuckerberg's own public posts, especially those about his family, reflect a
cautious approach to privacy, rarely showing his children's faces, presumably to
avoid facial recognition technologies. This personal practice seems in contrast
to the tools his platform offers for scanning users' pictures and faces. The
article also touches on the broader implications of Facebook's data practices,
particularly in developing countries where the platform's misuse has led to
harm. Dr. Zimmer believes Zuckerberg has had a generally positive impact but has
been naive about the broader effects of his platforms. He suggests that while
Zuckerberg cannot rectify past issues, he can acknowledge them and engage more
proactively to ensure his legacy remains positive.

This exploration of Zuckerberg's public remarks and Facebook's privacy practices
provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between social media,
personal privacy, and global impact.

Google has begun its long-anticipated move to phase out third-party cookies in
its Chrome browser, signaling a significant shift in how user data is handled
online. This change, as reported by Mashable, started with about one percent of
Chrome users, amounting to approximately 30 million people. This move is part of
Google's broader plan, announced back in 2020, to enhance user privacy and
address growing concerns over how personal data is used and shared online.

The decision to stop supporting third-party cookies comes amid scrutiny from EU
and UK regulators, who were concerned about the potential unfair advantage it
could give Google over its competitors. Third-party cookies have been a staple
of the internet for years, used for various purposes from storing user
preferences and login information to more controversial uses like tracking user
behavior and compiling detailed user profiles for advertising.

Google's new approach, dubbed the "Privacy Sandbox initiative," aims to create a
new system for ad customization that respects user privacy. This system will not
rely on the widespread tracking of individual user data. Instead, it introduces
the "Ad Topics" API feature, which categorizes users based on their interests

In the digital age, governments accumulate vast amounts of data. While this data
can enhance governance and public services, it also raises significant privacy
concerns. Tianlong Wu's research paper, "Research on Government Data Openness
and Citizen Privacy Protection in the Context of Big Data," delves into this
crucial balance. The paper primarily discusses how to improve the transparency
of government data while ensuring personal privacy protection in a big data
environment.

The study identifies the main issues in government data openness and citizen
privacy protection. One major challenge is the inadequate legal system for
privacy protection, especially in the context of rapidly evolving big data
technologies. There's also a notable lack of a comprehensive data open
supervision and management mechanism, leading to inefficient utilization and
potential privacy breaches. Public awareness and participation in data-related
processes remain low, often resulting in a 'digital divide' where vulnerable
groups face difficulties in accessing and utilizing government data.

Wu suggests several measures to address these challenges. These include
establishing a sound legal and regulatory system for data openness and privacy
protection, improving data management and supervision mechanisms, and enhancing
public awareness about the significance of government data openness. The paper
emphasizes that while the government's data disclosure work has made significant
progress, it requires ongoing adjustments and improvements to meet the
challenges of the big data era.

This research brings forth the essential question: How can we ensure that the
benefits of open government data are maximized without compromising individual
privacy? As we move forward, striking this balance will be crucial for
democratic governance and the protection of citizens' rights.

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the rise of quantum computing poses
new challenges, especially for critical infrastructures like power grids and
water systems. The paper "Cybersecurity in Critical Infrastructures: A
Post-Quantum Cryptography Perspective" by Javier Oliva del Moral et al.
addresses these challenges by exploring the integration of post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) in protecting critical infrastructure.

The paper highlights the vulnerability of current cryptographic systems to
quantum computing attacks, emphasizing the need for PQC, which remains secure
against both classical and quantum computational threats. It delves into various
PQC methods, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, and isogeny-based
cryptography, examining their suitability for critical infrastructure systems.

A key takeaway is the complex balance between implementing robust security
measures and maintaining the operational efficiency of critical infrastructures.
The paper underscores the importance of low-latency, high-performance
cryptographic solutions in industrial settings, where even minor delays can lead
to significant disruptions.

This research prompts important reflections: How ready are our critical systems
for the quantum computing era? And, what steps should industries take now to
ensure future security? As quantum computing continues to advance, the urgency
to transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic methods becomes more pressing,
marking a crucial step in safeguarding our essential services against emerging
cyber threats.

This paper, titled "Enhancing Privacy in the Internet of Vehicles via
Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography," delves into safeguarding privacy in Vehicular
Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), crucial for the increasingly popular Internet of
Vehicles (IoV). With the proliferation of IoV, privacy concerns are at an
all-time high due to the risk of data interception in smart city environments.

The research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Hyperelliptic Curve
Cryptography (HECC) in IoV contexts. The study compares three cryptographic
algorithms—Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), HECC genus 2 (HECC-2), and HECC
genus 3 (HECC-3)—to assess their suitability for ensuring secure communication
in VANETs. The evaluation, conducted using the ns-3 simulator, examines the
trade-offs between security, operational efficiency, and resource constraints in
these environments.

Results demonstrate that ECC offers significantly faster operation times
compared to HECC variants, making it more suitable for environments where speed
is essential. However, HECC, particularly genus 3, tends to provide stronger
privacy protection, albeit at the cost of larger message sizes and higher energy
consumption. This study raises critical considerations for the future of
vehicular communication: finding the optimal balance between robust privacy
protection and the practical limitations of vehicular networks.

Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel is intensifying
scrutiny on the privacy practices of car manufacturers. Concerns have been
raised about the handling of location data by these companies, particularly in
light of a New York Times report highlighting the misuse of such data in
domestic violence cases. Rosenworcel's inquiry, directed at nine car companies
and three mobile carriers, seeks clarity on how location data from connected
apps and devices is managed, including its collection, sharing, and potential
sale.

The issue extends beyond individual privacy breaches to broader commercial data
practices. California's privacy agency plans to review connected vehicles'
practices, citing the automatic collection of sensitive personal data. Mozilla,
a nonprofit organization, has labeled cars a "privacy nightmare," criticizing
the excessive data collection and sale without consumer control. Senator Ed
Markey also warned car companies against selling data that could be used by data
brokers to create detailed consumer profiles. These developments underscore a
growing concern about the evolving role of vehicles as data-centric devices,
raising questions about consumer privacy and the need for regulatory oversight.

The landscape of state privacy laws in the United States has become increasingly
complex by 2024. Currently, there are five state laws in effect, with four more
set to be enacted this year and several others in 2025 and 2026. These laws,
each with its unique set of rules and requirements, pose significant
implications for companies dealing with consumer data. Particularly noteworthy
is the fact that not all organizations will fall under these laws; applicability
depends on factors such as the number of individuals and revenue thresholds.
This creates a patchwork of compliance requirements for companies operating
across multiple states.

Importantly, these laws encompass various aspects like notice obligations,
consumer rights, data management choices, record-keeping, and vendor contracts.
States like California and Colorado are particularly stringent in their notice
obligations. The laws also introduce new dimensions to consumer privacy, such as
targeted advertising, information sale, sensitive information, and profiling.
For businesses, especially those with loyalty programs or those selling data,
this means an increased burden of compliance and the necessity of detailed
record-keeping. As 2024 progresses, organizations must critically evaluate their
activities to determine their scope under these laws and develop comprehensive
privacy programs that address these multifaceted requirements. This evolving
privacy landscape signifies a pivotal shift in how consumer data is handled and
protected in the United States, affecting both domestic and international
businesses.

Effective from December 31, 2023, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) presents
a new set of data privacy regulations for businesses operating in Utah. The
UCPA, considered more business-friendly compared to other state privacy laws
like California's CCPA/CPRA, still mandates significant obligations for
companies. It applies to businesses with annual revenues over $25 million, and
either process the data of 100,000+ Utah consumers or derive over 50% of their
revenue from selling personal data and process data of 25,000+ Utah residents.

The UCPA offers consumers certain rights, like accessing and deleting their
personal data (limited to data they provided) and opting out of data collection
for certain purposes. However, it does not include rights like profiling opt-out
or correcting inaccuracies, differentiating it from other state laws. It also
defines 'sale' strictly as the exchange of personal data for monetary
consideration, a narrower definition than seen in CCPA. Importantly, the act
excludes employee data and certain types of data governed by other federal laws,
and there is no private right of action for violations. Instead, the Utah
Division of Consumer Protection and the Attorney General's office will handle
enforcement, with potential fines for non-compliance.

For businesses, the UCPA requires a privacy policy detailing data processing
activities and sharing practices. They must also establish robust data security
measures, fulfill consumer requests within 45 days, and ensure data processing
contracts with processors. Non-discrimination and consent for processing
children's data under 13 are also emphasized. As the privacy landscape continues
to evolve, the UCPA signifies a tailored approach, balancing business interests
with consumer privacy rights in the digital age.
